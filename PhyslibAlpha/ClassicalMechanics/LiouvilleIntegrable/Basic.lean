# Liouville integrable systems

## i. Overview

A Hamiltonian system on a `2d`-dimensional phase space is *Liouville integrable* when it carries
`d` conserved quantities, one per degree of freedom, that are

- smooth,
- pairwise Poisson-commuting ("in involution"), and
- functionally independent, i.e. their phase-space gradients are linearly independent.

Functional independence cannot hold at every point of phase space in any interesting example: the
gradient of the Hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator vanishes at the equilibrium, and the Kepler
Hamiltonian is singular at the origin of position space. The definition therefore asks for the
conditions on an open *domain* `U` of phase space, which must be dense so that the conditions hold
generically. Without density the empty domain would make every Hamiltonian integrable.

This is the hypothesis of the Liouville–Arnold theorem, which further concludes the existence of
action-angle coordinates and invariant tori for the motion; that conclusion is not formalized here
(see the `TODO` below). What is formalized is the definition itself, together with its immediate
consequence: each of the `d` conserved quantities really is conserved along the Hamiltonian flow
inside `U`, by reducing to `deriv_comp_eq_poissonBracket` from
`Physlib.ClassicalMechanics.PoissonBracket`.

With one degree of freedom the conditions collapse: the Hamiltonian is the only conserved quantity,
involution is automatic, and independence says only that the gradient of the Hamiltonian does not
vanish. `LiouvilleIntegrableOn.oneDegreeOfFreedom` records this, and is how the harmonic oscillator
and the simple pendulum are shown to be integrable.

Following the convention of `poissonBracket`, a phase-space function `f : X → X → ℝ` is read as
`f p q` for a momentum `p` and a position `q`. Since PhysLib has no existing precedent for a
`FiniteDimensional`/`Module.finrank` hypothesis on an abstract phase space, position space is fixed
concretely as `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d)` for an explicit `d : ℕ`, matching the indexing convention
already used for e.g. `RigidBody (d : ℕ)`.

- `LiouvilleIntegrableOn` : the structure of a Liouville integrable system for a Hamiltonian `H`
  on an open dense domain `U` of phase space.
- `LiouvilleIntegrableOn.deriv_comp_eq_zero` : each conserved quantity has zero time derivative
  along a solution of Hamilton's equations for `H` which stays in `U`.
- `LiouvilleIntegrableOn.oneDegreeOfFreedom` : a system with one degree of freedom is Liouville
  integrable wherever its Hamiltonian is smooth with non-vanishing gradient.

-/

/-- A Liouville integrable system for a Hamiltonian `H` on an open dense domain `U` of the
`2d`-dimensional phase space `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d) × EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d)`, whose points
are read as `(p, q)`: `d` smooth conserved quantities, one per degree of freedom, that are pairwise
in involution and functionally independent at every point of `U`. -/

solution of Hamilton's equations for `H` which lies in the domain `U` at time `t`. -/
